## 🌐 What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
It is the **standard language used to create web pages**.

HTML is **not a programming language** — it is a **markup language**, which means it is used to **structure content** on the web.

With HTML, we define:

* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Images
* Links
* Buttons
* Forms
* Tables
* Lists

👉 Every website you see on the internet starts with HTML.

## 🕰️ History of HTML

* **1989** – HTML was invented by **Tim Berners-Lee**
* He created HTML to **share documents over the internet**
* **1991** – First version of HTML released
* **1995–2010** – HTML evolved with new versions
* **2014** – **HTML5** was officially released
* **Today** – HTML5 is the standard used worldwide

Earlier, documents were hard to share. HTML made it possible to:

* Link documents together (Hyperlinks)
* View content in browsers
* Share information globally

## 🤔 Why is HTML Used?

HTML is used because it:

### ✅ 1. Creates the Structure of a Web Page

HTML acts like the **skeleton of a body**.

Example:

```html
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

HTML works in:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge
* Safari
  (no extra installation needed)

### ✅ 3. Easy to Learn

### ✅ 4. Works with CSS and JavaScript

* **HTML** → Structure
* **CSS** → Style (colors, design)
* **JavaScript** → Behavior (clicks, actions)

### ✅ 5. Required for Web Development

To become:

* Frontend Developer
* Full Stack Developer
* Web Designer

👉 HTML is **mandatory**

## 🧱 Simple Example of HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

## 👶 HTML Explained for a 5-Year-Old

* HTML is like **building blocks**
* It tells the computer:

  * This is a **title**
  * This is **text**
  * This is an **image**

Just like LEGO 🧱 builds a house, HTML builds a website.
